# Protocol Labs Patent Non-Aggression Pledge

Protocol Labs will not enforce any of the patents on any software invention Protocol Labs owns now or in the future, except against a party who files, threatens, or voluntarily participates in a claim for patent infringement against (i) Protocol Labs or (ii) any third party based on that party's use or distribution of technologies created by Protocol Labs.

This pledge is intended to be a legally binding statement. However, we may still enter into license agreements under individually negotiated terms for those who wish to use Protocol Labs technology but cannot or do not wish to rely on this pledge alone.
